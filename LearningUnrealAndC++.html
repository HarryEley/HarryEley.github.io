									<h2>Overview - IN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have been developing my skills in using Unreal Engine and C++. To accomplish this, I have been following a Udemy course to aid in my learning (This course can be found
									<a target="_blank" href=https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse /> here</a>). For these projects, I used Unreal Engine Version 5.1.
								</p>
								<p>
									Within this course, I have created 3 different game demos. These being Warehouse Wreckage, Obstacle Assult, and Crypt Raider, with the complexity of these projects
									increasing after each. These games focus on developing my understanding of different aspects of working in Unreal Engine and C++. After developing each of these games,
									I then proceeded to test my knowledge by adding my own mechanic to the game, whilst also improving the tutorial code where possible. I did this so that I could develop 
									better knowledge of using C++, resulting in me having a much greater understanding of how to use it. 
								</p>

												<p>
													<br />
													Warehouse Wreckage is a first-person destruction game where the player can run around shooting different environmental items to knock them over.
													Some examples of these items are cones, barrels, shelves, and more. The player then has access to restart the level as many times as they want.
													I created this game with a focus on learning Unreal Engine's basic features, including getting a good understanding of how to use blueprints to
													perform simple tasks.
												</p>
												<h4>What I focused on whilst making this:</h4>
												<p>
													During this project I focused on improving my basic in-engine skills. This included how to properly make use of the viewport, moving/placing actors,
													BSP, basic Blueprint usage, and more. Within this game, I used Blueprints to spawn in objects, shoot out projectiles, and manage the scene. This project
													used the default Unreal Engine player controller.
												</p>

													<h4>Level Blueprint</h4>
													<img src="images/WarehouseWreckage/LevelBlueprint.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														Above is the main level Blueprint responsible for spawning in a projectile and firing it in a forward direction.
														<br />
														<br />
														The top section takes any input from the backspace key and calls the ReloadLevel function when this key is pressed. This function gets the
														current level name and then passes this into an "OpenLevel(by name)" node, resulting in the level reloading.
														<br />
														<br />
														The bottom section is responsible for spawning a projectile when the spacebar key in pressed. This blueprint uses a branch so that when the 
														space bar key is pressed, it checks if it has ammo and either spawns in a new projectile or reloads the gun, calling the relevant functions 
														to do so.
													</p>

													<h4>Spawn Projectile Function</h4>
													<img src="images/WarehouseWreckage/Level_SpawnProjectile.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														The Spawn Projectile function is responsible for spawning in a new projectile into the level and ensuring an impulse is applied upon this 
														creation. When called, this function spawns in a new projectile, ensuring the rotation and position is taken from the player pawn, and then 
														calls the add impulse function, passing this new projectile as a target reference.
													</p>

													<h4>Add Impulse Function</h4>
													<img src="images/WarehouseWreckage/AddImpulse.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														When called, this function gets an actor and applies an impulse force in the forward direction with a given amount of force.
													</p>


													<h4>Decrease Ammo Function</h4>
													<img src="images/WarehouseWreckage/Level_DecreaseAmmo.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														When called, this function lowers the ammo count by one
													</p>

													<h4>Overview:</h4>

												<p>
													Completing this blueprint system and combining it with Unreal Engine's other built-in features have been able to give me a great understanding of
													the basic functionaility of this engine and how to make good use of it.

											<section>
												<br />
												<p>
													Obstacle Assault is a third-person parkour game where the player has to use their environment in order to progress on throughout the level.
													Some different environmental features includes moving platforms, rotating platforms, and jumping puzzles. I created this game with a focus 
													on learning basic C++ usage for scripts in Unreal Engine, and how I can use these scripts to manipulate the environment during play time.
												</p>
												<h4>What I focused on whilst making this:</h4>
												<p>
													During this project, I focused on learning basic C++ usage in Unreal. This included learning how to manipulate an actor's movement and rotation
													during run time. The script I made was a configurable C++ script that allowed the user to make an actor move to and from a given distance and
													direction, whilst also allowing them to configure it to have a rotation. I also looked into creating C++ actors, Unreal Engine's live coding 
													feature, and linking blueprint to C++.
												</p>
												<!--
													-> Learning basic C++ in Unreal
														-> Make platforms move
															-> configurable speed
															-> Backward and forward
														-> Rotation
															-> Rotating platforms

													-> Creating a C++ Actor
													-> C++ compilation and live coding
													-> Linking blueprint to C++
													-> Setting own custom character class

													Things I did myself:
														-> Noticed you could crouch in the air
															-> fixed through creating branch checking whether grounded or not
														-> Added option for platform to move between multiple locations

													<p>Above is an image containing two types of moving blocks. The stone block on the right moves up and down to allow the player access to higher ground,
													meanwhile the purple cubes move side to side to provide an obstacle to the player as they move on within the level.</p>

													<h4>MovingPlatform.h</h4>
													<img src="images/ObstacleAssault/MovingPlatformH.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														Above is the header file for the MovingPlatform script. I ensured to categorize and allow the main variables to be edited within the editor so that
														the settings can be customized for different objects.
													</p>
													<h4>MovingPlatform.cpp</h4>
													<img src="images/ObstacleAssault/MovingPlatformCPP.PNG" alt="" />
													<p>
														Above is the main C++ script that handles moving and rotating an actor. Every tick this script calls 2 functions: MovePlatform() and RotatePlatform(),
														passing DeltaTime into these so it can be used for calculations.
														<br />
														<br />
														The MovePlatform() function applies a movement to the actor in a preset direction and speed. It functions through checking if the actor has reached
														it's destination, in which if it has, it will reset it's start location and send the actor back in the direction it came from. However, If the actor 
														hasn't reached it's destination, the actor will be moved towards it's destination.
														<br />
														<br />
														The RotatePlatform() function applies a local rotation to the actor by a preset rotationSpeed value.

													<h4>Overview:</h4>
												</header>
												<p>
													Completing this C++ system and implementing it into Unreal Engine has helped me develop an understanding of how C++ scripts function, and how I
													can use them to manipulate actors throughout the scene. From doing this project, I have learnt how to create, add functionality to, and set up 
													c++ scripts so they can function within an Unreal Engine project. 
													<br />
													<br />
													I plan to come back to this project in the future to add greater functionality and ideas I have to make the gameplay much more enjoyable and to
													add more depth to the gameplay loop.
