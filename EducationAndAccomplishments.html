										<h2>Ba(Hons) Game Development: Programming : 2020-2023</h2>
										<p>Grade: Unknown</p>

									<p>

									</p>
									<p>
										I am currently enrolled in a games programming course at Falmouth University. Throughout this course, I have worked on numerous projects both within a team and as an individual.
										This includes a yearly main group project where I worked with other specialisms (for instance designers, artists, writers, and more) to create a games throughout the year, using
										industry standard practices to help us do so.

										<h3>Year 2:</h3>
										<h1>Comp250: Individual Specialist Computer Project: Artificial Intelligence - Boids simulated ecosystem</h1>
										<br />
										This project included a specialist individual project focused around artificial intelligence. We were tasked with creating any AI system we wanted,
										having us pitch the idea and then develop it. For this project, I decided to create an ecosystem simulation using flocking behaviours as the base
										of this AI. The premise of this was to create an ecosystem that could adapt to their environment through natural selection, having the boids reproduce
										to pass on their genes and create genetic variation. This simulation also included many variables the user could tinker with, for instance the significance
										of food and water sources, the average life span for the agents, and much more.
										<br />
										A further write-up on this project can be found <a href="BoidsSimulatedEcosystem.html">here</a>
										<br />
										<br />

										<h1>Comp280: Specialisms in Creating Computing - Multiplayer, AI, security and optimisation</h1>
										<br />
										For this assignment, as an individual, I was tasked to create any game I wanted, although it had to contain a few given features. For this game,
										I had to include networking and artificial intelligence, conduct a heuristic analysis into my own game, and explore possible optimisations throughout
										my scripts. I decided to create a 1st person melee game where the player could explore around and fight different enemies, with the ability to play
										the game in multiplayer. Combat focused around an element system, where enemies and weapons had element types in which all have strengths and weaknesses
										for different elements.
										<br />
										<br />
										I was also given a C# console program to increase security for and find, alongside finding any other flaws in this program. This program was a simple
										stocks game, allowing the user to log into the server and trade different items, with the aim to have the highest balance out of all accounts. I had to find
										flaws in the code that resulted in crashes and enabled the user to do things they weren't meant to have access to.

										<br />
										<br />

										<h1>Gam210: Theory ii: form & user Experience - Essay on learning in Sekiro</h1>
										<br />
										This assignment involved integrating theory research with playtesting to produce an essay indetifying the relationship between theoretical and practical.
										For this essay, I chose to look into how discovery learning is used in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice to help teach the player how and when to use the defensive
										options available to them. Writing this essay involved researching into different learning theories and running play testing sessions to see how well the
										game does in teachign the player these different mechanics, helping me to better understand how to analyse and play test a game.
										<br />
										<br />

										<h1>Gam220: World Creation Project: Pre-Production - multi-discipline project pre-production</h1>
										<br />
										This module included creating 2 game concept demos as a multi-discipline team. Our first game concept was a hover-bike exploration game where the player
										could roam around an open world, completing puzzles and unlocking more areas as they progress. For this concept, I created the hoverbike controller,
										aiming for realistic suspension-like behaviour whilst also providing a great feel for the player. From this, I got a much better understanding of how
										to properly research relevant physics and how to integrate these different equations and behaviours into my scripts and systems to help provide
										great realism to the player experience.
										<br />
										Alongside this, I also worked on the main movement in the 2nd prototype. This prototype was a gliding game, aiming for a relaxing and satisfying feel.
										The aim was for the player to glide around different levels, collecting different resources to upgrade glider and help them more easily progress through
										the story. This prototype went on to be the game we made for our Gam240 project, found <a href="Freeflight.html">here</a>
										<br />
										<br />

										<h1>Gam240: World Creation Project: Production - Producing game from Gam220</h1>
										<br />
										This assignment was my main group project of 2nd year, where we were tasked to produce one of the concepts we had made for the previous Gam220 group project. 
										This project taught me how to better work in a multi-disciplinary team using industry-standard practices, such as SCRUM, stand up meetings, and generally how
										to work effectively and efficiently with other developers. We decided to produce and create a gliding game with a focus on exploration. For this game I 
										developed and maintained numerous systems, from resource management and a collectables system, to a custom AI pathing editor. 
										<br />
										A further description of this game and how it was developed can be found <a href="Freeflight.html">here</a>.

										<br />
										<br />
										<h3>Year 1:</h3>
										<h1>Comp120: Creative Computing - Tinkering graphics/audio</h1>
										<br />
										Throughout this project, I had to create two applications. The first application allowed the user to import an image and apply various filters to
										this image. These filters could be used numerous times and, when applicable, the strength of these filters could be changed to help the user get
										their desired edit. The user could then to save their new image to their chosen storage location. Examples of filters included in this software
										are blur, inverse colouring, greyscale, colour correction, and more.
										<br />
										<br />
										The second application allowed the user to create different noises and sequences, edit them, and then save it to their computer as a wav.
										Some features included in this applciation were importing sound clips, changing wave functions, adding echo, amplitude scaling, phase inversion,
										white noise, audio splicing, wavelength scaling, and reversing audio.
										<br />
										<br />
										Unfortunately I no longer have access to the code or project for these applications so cannot provide code snippets or screenshots.

										<br />
										<br />

										<h1>Comp140: Individual Creative Computing Project - Custom controller fishing game</h1>
										<br />
										For this project, I was tasked with creating a custom controller using an Arduino and a game to play with it. I decided to create a 2D fishing game
										where the player could use my custom controller like a real life fishing rod. The player would cast out their hook by placing a water level sensor
										into a cup of water, and then turn a rotary encoder to lower and raise their line to catch different types of fish. This rotary encoder could also
										be used as a button for navigating the game's different menus.
										<br /><br />
										Further information on this project can be found <a href="CustomController.html">here</a>

										<br /><br />
										<h1>Gam110: Development Principles - Create a game concept and pitched it</h1>
										<br />

										Throughout this module, we learned how to develop and present a game pitch, whilst also how to prepare a rough prototype. This was a group project
										where different game development specialisms came together to help build a world and create a presentation and pitch for a game we wanted to create
										for our next module. Together we created and developed ideas for our game, collaborating together using different specialist knowledge to help us
										cover all bases of the pitch.
										<br /><br />
										This pitch led to my Gam130 project, which can be found <a href="ProjectStealth.html">here</a>

										<br /><br />
										<h1>Gam120: Theory 1: Reading Experiences - Theory module</h1>
										<br />
										This module was purely theory, learning how to write a textual analysis about the effect a game has on it's player and how we can create a particular
										player experience. For my essay, I did a textual analysis of the themes of loyalty within Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, exploring where these themes are
										found and the different ways they can effect the player. From this, I learnt how to understand how to form a textual analysis and see how games are
										received by an audience, being able to analyse specific player experiences throughout gameplay.
										<br /><br />

										<h1>Gam130: Multidisciplinary Development Practice - Creating our pitched game</h1>
										<br />
										This module was about creating the game we pitched for our Gam110 module. With a team of combined specialisms, we had to produce a game using standard
										industry practices to ensure for it to be made to a high quality. Using our specialisms to our advantage, we produced a 3D stealth game where the player
										could manouver around a facility, avoiding drones and completing puzzles to progress through the levels.
										<br /><br />
										The game we made for this project can be found <a href="ProjectStealth.html">here</a>, with further descriptions of scripts, gameplay, and how it was developed.
